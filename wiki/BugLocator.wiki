#summary A tool for bug locating.

= Introduction=

This page describes !BugLocator - the software we developed for our research work on locating the source code files that need to be changed. !BugLocator ranks all files based on the textual similarity between the initial bug report and the source code using a new similarity measure, taking into consideration information about similar bugs that have been fixed before. 


= Download and Installation =

!BugLocator is free for scientific use only. More information about !BugLocator can be found at the following paper: 
  _Jian Zhou, Hongyu Zhang, and David Lo, Where Should the Bugs be Fixed? More    Accurate Information Retrieval-Based Bug Localization based on Bugs Reports, In  Proc. ICSE 2012, Zurich, Switzerland, June 2012_
This program was developed with Java and the source code is available from [http://code.google.com/p/bugcenter/downloads/list Download page].

After unpackting the file, you can find these: 
  * !BugLocator.jar
  * !ReadMe.txt
  * Data Folder(xml examples)
= How to use=
java -jar !BugLocator [-options] 

where options must include:

-b	indicates the bug information file,the bug information file must be .xml file in the data folder.

-s	indicates the source code directory.

-a	indicates the alpha factor for combining vsmScore and simiScore

-o	indicates the result file,the format of result file is "bug id, relevant source code file,rank(start with 0),score".

For example the command may be "java -jar !BugLocator -b E:\Data&Tool\data\SWTBugRepository.xml -s E:\Data&Tool\swt-3.1\src -a 0.2 -o E:\Data&Tool\output.txt" for SWT system
